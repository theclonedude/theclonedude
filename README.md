### What?

I develop websites which offer almost all features that many huge web services offer. (not every feature is possible, e.g. which involve actual money)

The source code for all the "clones" of the websites are public with a Licence that can be found in each of the individual repositories and is **GPL 3** if a LICENSE file is not found in a repository.

> I might also develop the same websites with an alternate take or adding some improvements. The source code in this case will not be open.

### Why?

- Portfolio
- Practice
- Wanted to do this since a long time
